## How The Application Works 

This software has functions that can scrape books in 3 ways
1. By extracting details for a single product 
2. By extracting details of all products in a single category
3. By extracting details of products from every category

Once you run the software, you will be presented with a menu that has 4 options:

#### OPTION 1 - For a single book
      Requires you to enter the URL of the book you need to extract information


####  OPTION 2 - For all books in single category
      Requires you to enter the URL of a category page on the website


#### OPTION 3 - For all books in every category
      Does not need any URL as  it will be extract for all books across all categories


#### OPTION 4 - Exit
      Allows to exit the software


The following details will be extracted for each book
1. universal product_code (upc)
2. title
3. price_including_tax
4. price_excluding_tax
5. number_available
6. product_description
7. category
8. review_rating
9. image_url

As the software runs, 2 directories will be created.  "image_folder" will be for the images of the book covers and the "csv_folder" will be for the csv files which will contain all details of the books. Both directories will have sub-directories which will be autogenerated as the software runs and then named based on book categories.
